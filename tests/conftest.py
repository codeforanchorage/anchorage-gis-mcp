"""Shared pytest fixtures.

The MCP server keeps its PluginManager and MCPServer as module-level
globals in ``server.http_handler`` so a warm Lambda container can reuse
them across invocations. That is right for production and hostile to
tests: anything a test assigns to those names outlives the test and is
visible to every test that runs afterwards, in any file.

That is not hypothetical. ``test_http_handler.py`` installs a MagicMock
to prove the initializer reuses an existing instance; the Lambda
adapter's cleanup path then does ``await _plugin_manager.shutdown()``,
and a plain MagicMock is not awaitable, so ``test_aws_lambda.py`` failed
with "'MagicMock' object can't be awaited". It only stayed hidden
because test_aws_lambda sorts before test_http_handler alphabetically --
running the two files in the other order, or shuffling test order, or
renaming either file, surfaces it.

Restoring the globals around every test fixes the whole class of
problem rather than the one instance of it.
