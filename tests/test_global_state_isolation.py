"""Guards the autouse fixture that isolates server.http_handler globals.

These two tests are a pair and depend on running in definition order,
which is pytest's default within a file. The first deliberately leaks a
non-awaitable mock into the module globals; the second asserts it did
not survive. If tests/conftest.py's reset fixture is removed or broken,
the second test fails -- which is the point.

Without that fixture the leak reaches server/adapters/aws_lambda.py's
cleanup path, which does ``await _plugin_manager.shutdown()`` and dies
with "'MagicMock' object can't be awaited".
